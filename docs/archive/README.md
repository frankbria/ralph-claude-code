## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see:

- [README.md](../../README.md) - User documentation with use cases
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) - Developer guide
- [docs/ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) - Development roadmap
- [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) - System architecture

## Why These Are Archived

These documents served their purpose during development but are now superseded by:

1. **README.md** - Consolidated use cases and user guide
2. **ROADMAP.md** - Current development status and future plans
3. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Up-to-date architectural patterns

The archive preserves this work for historical reference and shows the evolution of Ralph's design and implementation.

# ShellCheck configuration for Ralph

# === Production Code ===

# SC2016 - Expressions don't expand in single quotes
# (Intentional in sed patterns and echo statements for shell config)
disable=SC2016

# SC2155 - Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# (Consistent style choice throughout codebase - failures caught by error handling)
disable=SC2155

# SC2162 - read without -r
# (Acceptable for simple user input)
disable=SC2162

# SC2012 - Use find instead of ls
# (ls is acceptable for simple time-sorted listings)
disable=SC2012

# SC2035 - Use ./*glob*
# (chmod is safe in our context)
disable=SC2035

# === Test Code ===

# SC1091 - Not following sourced files
# (Test helpers are sourced dynamically, paths are correct)
disable=SC1091

# SC2030 - Modification of variable is local
# SC2031 - Variable was modified in a subshell
# (Expected behavior in test subshells and setup/teardown)
disable=SC2030
disable=SC2031

# SC2034 - Variable appears unused
# (Test fixtures and mocks define variables for external use)
disable=SC2034

# SC2086 - Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
# (Intentional in test assertions and mock functions)
disable=SC2086

# SC2154 - Variable is referenced but not assigned
# (BATS framework provides variables like $status, $output, $lines)
disable=SC2154

# SC2164 - Use 'cd ... || exit' or 'cd ... || return'
# (Test code uses cd within controlled teardown context)
disable=SC2164

# SC2329 - Function is never invoked
# (Mock functions are invoked indirectly by test framework)
disable=SC2329

# SC2005 - Useless echo? Instead of 'echo $(cmd)', just use 'cmd'
# (Style preference in test fixtures for clarity)
disable=SC2005
